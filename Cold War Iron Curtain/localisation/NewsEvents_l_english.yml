Among other things, the 15 closest allies to Hitler (who were still alive) were sentenced to either death or life imprisonment. The top 10 prominent members of the political and military leadership of Nazi Germany were executed by hanging. However, several other Nazi officals would commit suicide while waiting for trial. The only exception is Speer, who was to only one to show any remorse. 7 Nazi officals would be imprisioned in Spandau Prision, nicknamed the Spandau Seven, including Albert Speer, Rudolf Hess, Karl Dönitz, and others being sentenced to prision for varying amounts. The world can now heal knowing that the men who caused World War II and the suffering behind it are either dead, imprisioned, or waiting for trial."

 mccarthy.1.d:0 "Wisconsin Republican Joseph R. McCarthy first won election to the Senate in 1946 during a campaign marked by much anticommunist Red-baiting. Partially in response to Republican Party victories, President Harry S. Truman tried to demonstrate his own concern about the threat of Communism by setting up a loyalty program for federal employees. He also asked the Justice Department to compile an official list of 78 subversive organizations. As the midterm election year got underway, former State Department official Alger Hiss, suspected of espionage, was convicted of perjury. McCarthy, in a speech at Wheeling, West Virginia, mounted an attack on Truman’s foreign policy agenda by charging that the State Department and its Secretary, Dean Acheson, harbored “traitorous” Communists. There is some dispute about the number of Communists McCarthy claimed to have known about. Though advance copies of this speech distributed to the press record the number as 205, McCarthy quickly revised this claim. Both in a letter he wrote to President Truman the next day and in an “official” transcript of the speech that McCarthy submitted to the Congressional Record ten days later he uses the number 57. Although McCarthy displayed this list of names both in Wheeling and then later on the Senate floor, he never made the list public."

 raj.7.t:0 "Demand Goa"
 raj.7.d:0 "For years we have been trying to peacefully take back Goa from the hands of their imperial oppressors but to no avail. Goa has been part of India for thousands of years and for Portugal to claim that it is an integral part of their country is just absurd. Portugal has been staunchly holding onto their colonies in Africa and all over the world for years after the great war, and it seems like they have no intention of letting any of them go. It appears that our peaceful attempts have failed and we might have to resort to more violent means..."
