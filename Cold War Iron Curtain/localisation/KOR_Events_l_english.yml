 korea.47.d:0 "Amidst a global climate of discontent towards authority and a national distaste toward the South Korean government, the embers of protest flared there this year. For the past two years, the people of South Korea have been growing ever more resentful of their president, Syngman Rhee, in office since 1948. In 1958, fearing a loss of power, President Rhee forced a shift in the nation’s laws that expanded executive power extensively. The following year, Rhee’s two largest political rivals for the 1960 presidential election died under suspicious circumstances and one of his closest political allies was elected vice president by fraudulent vote, leading to widespread rumors of Rhee maintaining power by blood and intrigue. This year Koreans announced they’d had enough. What began as a small protest by the Democratic Party exploded in scale after the police killed a student protestor, with a tear gas shell. As protests swelled throughout April, outnumbered soldiers and police fought a losing battle before finally refusing to fire on the marchers. Left at the mercy of his electorate, Rhee was quick to step down and flee the country. The people of South Korea now look to reorganize their republic on a parliamentary model, hoping to curb the power of the executive and ensure that no more corrupt strongmen seize the reins of power."
 sov.100.d:0 "Since the Berlin Blockade of 1947, the United States and the Soviet Union have been at odds, undermining one another through proxy wars, shows of force, and sabotage. However, in light of the sudden Arab-Israeli war, American president Lyndon B. Johnson and Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin met in Glassboro, New Jersey to discuss the relations of their opposing countries.  Over the course of three days, Kosygin and Johnson discussed the crisis in the Middle East, a solution to the ongoing Vietnam war, and limiting the ongoing arms race between America and the Soviet Union. Though no significant agreement was reached, the amicable atmosphere of the summit has frequently been called the "Spirit of Glassboro". This Spirit has many on both sides hoping for closer and friendlier ties between the rival nations."

In response to this act of domestic terrorism, the Russian Government has issued an immediate press ban on all mentions relating to the attempt on Brezhnev's life, clearly, despite it's military might and geopolitical overeach, it was shown on this day, in an event all to reminiscent of the 1914 assassination of Franz Ferdinand, that the Soviet Union is not as invulnerable as it's leadership would have the western world believe."
