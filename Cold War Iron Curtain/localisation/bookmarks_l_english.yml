 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "A Divided World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Second World War and the fall of the Axis, the world is split in two: Capitalism and Communism. A political and espionage war is taking place throughout the world. Revolts are happening across asia. Civil wars are threatening the stability of the world. Now, it is up to you to decide the fate of this world."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The era of British Imperialism has come to an end. The allure of independence is far too great for those subjugated under the British crown. Her colonies around the world are seeing increases in popularity for Nationalist and Communist movements alike. As the United Kingdom's global power wanes, it looks to its Western allies to safeguard against the threat of Communism, now closer than ever. Long gone are the fears of Oswald Mosley, now the fear of Communism grips the hearts of the British Commonwealth."
 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Finally free of both US and Japanese occupation, the newly established Republic of Korea was hopeful for peaceful reunification with their separated countrymen above the 38th parallel. But after the suspicious assassination of the only senior politician willing to negotiate with the North and the staunch anti-Communist Lee Seung Man winning the presidency, that hope was waning fast. The US may have handed over the keys but neither Korea is in control, and with both republics claiming the peninsula conflict is inevitable."
 WGR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The once great German nation has been defeated once more. With the glory of the German empire just a distant memory, and the euphoria of their conquests just years earlier marred by shame and frustration, the German people once again find themselves at the barrel of a gun. Occupied by both superpowers of the world, they are the chess board for their political games. Tired are the people of Germany, with a great deal of rebuilding to do. All that's left is hope for de escalation and reunification with their Eastern brethren."
 DDR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under Soviet Military governorship, the people of East Germany find themselves under the rule of the very people they oppressed. Morale is low, but things are looking up as plans are in place to create a German Democratic Republic. With Soviet leaderships, construction is making good progress, but life is difficult as the society has become strictly regimented and the full blame of the war is laid upon their shoulders. Already, large portions of the population have adopted the Communist ideology wholeheartedly, creating an ideological divide between the two Germany’s that may last for generations…"
 KPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shortly following the declaration of the Republic of Korea, revolutionary Kim Il Sung along with the Soviet Civil Administration have drafted the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Now independent of Soviet control and with borders with two powerful Communist nations Kim is poised to liberate his comrades below the 38th parallel. With Soviet equipment, Chinese manpower and a unified population under the Juche system, the War for Korean Reunification should be a cakewalk. After all, their guardian, the United States, is busy with bigger problems…"
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Japanese have been defeated and the ceasefire with the Kuomintang has broken. The People’s Liberation Army has grown exponentially and with the equipment left behind by the Japanese, the People’s Republic is prepared the secure the rest of China. Despite minimal assistance from the Soviet Union, the leadership of Mao Ze Dong following the Great March has allowed Chinese Communism to flourish. Just a few more key cities, and China shall finally be united!"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thanks to the sacrifice of millions of brave Communists, Fascism has for the most part been wiped off of the Earth. But behind the fallen monster hides an even greater threat. The threat of Capitalism. Only having just liberated themselves, the Soviet Union must stand up to protect the world from yet another imperialistic system. The people of the world require a strong guiding hand, and there is no better candidate than the Soviet Union. Communism is gaining momentum, and Joseph Stalin intends to keep it that way."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the United States victory in the Second World War, it has positioned itself as the champion of Western Democracy. Strongly upholding its Capitalist values, it vehemently opposes the Communist East, led by the Soviet Union. Instead of demilitarizing after the destruction caused by WW2, the nation's military continues to grow to face the red menace. But now that nukes are on the table for both sides, could the United States and the West truly survive against such a formidable foe?"
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Liberation at last! India, having just won their independence from the weakened British, finds itself in a precarious situation. The nation is choc-full of valuable resources that other countries seek to exploit. This combined with the current government’s strategy of neutrality makes India a vulnerable target. Is an independent India short lived, or will a change in the winds of global politics allow this fledgling nation to survive an ideological war spanning all the continents of the world?"
 ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Zionism has finally been realized and a Jewish state has been established. Although the first few years were marred by the Arab-Israeli War, the Israelites with the help of their Western allies have not only fought off the Arabs but seized additional land. The Holy Land is splintered and surrounded by hostile forces but the Jewish resolve, hardened by the holocaust, is resilient. Not since before the Romans had there been an independent Jewish state, and the Jews do not intend to let this opportunity slip through their fingers."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the Yugoslav-Soviet split in 1948, Tito’s model of Market Socialism was working well with funding from the United State’ Marshall Plan. Yugoslavia, while being greatly damaged by Italian and German occupation found themselves with a better quality of living than any other Communist state. However, their political stability was something else entirely. Tito was beloved by his countrymen, but his strategy of neutrality was despised by both East and West. With constant threats from both sides, can Yugoslavia maintain itself as an independent Socialist country?"
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite being on the losing side of WW2, Finland managed to stay independent and not share the fate of east European countries. Now, as the Cold War has started, it must make a choice. Conform the Soviets, or seek help from other directions?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."

However, as the new decade comes, the GDR is still plagued by many problems, most notable being the Republikflucht, in which the citizens of GDR escape to west. Along with economic and internal problems, Ulbricht must act soon or risk being ousted, or worse."

During this however he has faced many obstacles. Will Mao succeed or will he be forgotten to history?"
 CUB_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Cuba, now under Castro turned communist just a year ago. Unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. While the US first reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution, Castro's legalization of the Communist party and the hundreds of executions that followed caused a deterioration in the relationship between the two countries. It remains to be seen what the future brings. It sure won't be peace."
 VIE_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on 26 October 1955, with Ngo Dinh Diem as its first president. A total opposite to the communist North, the south is supported by the US. The situation resembles the Korean situation. Will this lead to war as well?"
