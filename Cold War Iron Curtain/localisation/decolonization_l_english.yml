 britishdecolonization.1.d:0 "The aftermath of World War I brought the Treaty of Versailles to be signed on June 28,1919 by the Central Powers and Entente. The former League of Nations would partition German East Africa on July 20, 1922 with Belgium and Britain. Tanganyika was assigned into a Class B Mandate to be released once independence was possible. The new United Nations Trust Territory Committee reassigned us the colony in 1946, and a independence referendum to be supported. Recent polling has showed that 67% of colonists in Tanganyika are ready to be independent. With this in mind, Tanganyika does offer a lot of resources and transportation routes for our other colonies in the area. Should we allow Tanganyika to become an independent nation or not?"

 cameroon.411.d:0 "The French Republic today announced the end of the Class B Mandate over Cameroun after the 42 year old Mandate. Cameroun was created on July 20, 1920 after a partition of former German Cameroon. The United Kingdom would receive a part of a divided Cameroon, while France received the rest. A Class B Mandate was put on Cameroun by the former League of Nations to be released when independence was possible. After World War II, the new United Nations Trust Territory Committee was formed to monitor the Mandates left over from World War I. Independence was became more and more popular after elections in 1955 with independence parties gaining seats in the congress. Independence movements recently grew over the last few years, and even a rebellion broke out due to liberation fronts. The French Republic lowered the French flag at 11:59 am and rose the Republic of Cameroon's flag. The French Government has begun the process of removing colonial operations in Cameroon. Cameroon has officially been decolonized and the Class B Mandate has been lifted after 42 years of French operations."
