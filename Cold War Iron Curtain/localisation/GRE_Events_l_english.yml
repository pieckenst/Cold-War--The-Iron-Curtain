 greece.0.t:0 "Death of a Prime Minister"
 greece.0.d:0 "	Today Greece mourns one of its children. Themistoklis Sofoulis, our prime minister passed away at the age of 88. He was born in 1860 in Vathy in the island of Samos. He studies philosophy in the  National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and then went to Germany where he specialized in archaeology. He entered in the Greek political arena after the declaration of union between Samos and Greece in 1913. Prior to this, he was involved in the Samian politics and played a big part on the union process. In the election of May 1915, Sofoulis was elected deputy in the Greek parliament and served as Interior Minister under Eleftherios Venizelos. When in 1920 Venizelos became self-exiled, Sofoulis took the leadership of the party. In 1924 he became Prime Minister for the first time. During the interwar period Sofoulis was one of the central political figures in Greece. After the Greece surrender to the Axis in 1941, Sofoulis remained passive as almost all Greek Politician.  After the liberation, he became Prime Minister until the april of 1946 and tried to prevent the outbreak of the civil war. However his efforts failed and as a result he abstained from politics for a short period of time. On 7 September 1947 he  once again became prime minister in a coalition government of the Liberal Party and the People's Party. Sofoulis undertook further efforts to end the civil war, by proposing to EAM a general amnesty and a new coalition government between it and his party. However, these proposals were collapsed under heavy USA pressure and so the civil war took its course."
